## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a game developer focused on creating immersive 2D and 3D experiences using Unity and C#. This project showcases my approach to building engaging, interactive games with a strong emphasis on core game logic, physics-based interactions, and performance optimization.

At the heart of each project is a clean and modular game logic architecture. From player movement and enemy AI to level management and event systems, I structure scripts and game objects to encourage scalability and reusability. Using Unityâ€™s component-based design, I break complex behaviors into manageable systems, making the development process more maintainable and adaptable across different game types.

This repository also explores the integration of Unityâ€™s 2D and 3D physics engines. Rigidbodies, colliders, raycasting, and custom physics interactions are used to bring gameplay elements to lifeâ€”whether it's a platformer with precise jump mechanics or a 3D environment with dynamic object collisions. Physics settings are finely tuned to ensure realistic behavior while maintaining game responsiveness and control.

Performance is a key focus, especially in resource-intensive scenes. I apply best practices such as object pooling, LOD (Level of Detail), efficient update loops, and memory profiling to keep frame rates high and CPU/GPU usage low. Additionally, asynchronous loading and lightweight scripting patterns are implemented to improve load times and runtime stability across platforms.

Whether youâ€™re a fellow developer exploring Unity best practices, or someone interested in how polished gameplay is brought to life through code and physics, this repository provides a hands-on look at the core systems behind responsive, well-optimized games.
